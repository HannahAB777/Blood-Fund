# Blood Fund


## Description

According to life blood australia 1 in 2 donations are being canceled currently. One of the main reasons for this is corona virus infection. This got me thinking about the limited groups of people we are able to source from and where to find more blood when we are in such desperate need. Specifically gay men and those who enage in sex with gay men. I wanted to explore the data from this group and other fringe groups affected by donation bans so see how much clean blood is lost to prove empirically that these sources can be valuable donners and challenge internalized homophobia and other unconscious cultural bias.
To do this, I wanted to show how much blood was lost through a reporting system. Were when a member of a banned group blood tests are clean they can pledge their desire to donate their blood. I would then display this donation in terms of millimeters lost (470ml whole blood). In the hope that seeing these numbers in real time the general public would understand the true impact of these laws. Not only in the blood but the ignorance they inspire, instilling fear and homopobic leading to violence and bigotry.
